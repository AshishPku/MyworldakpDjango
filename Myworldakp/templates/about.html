              Hello I am <strong>Ashish kumar</strong> from an engineering college(Malaviya National Institute of technology,jaipur) specific in electronics and communication engineering.
              My work is to provide a common platform so that interested can work on a group in the field of electronics i.e. on some projects provided to them.
              We hire students if they have some basic knowledge about electronics.
              The requitment process is following:-
              1>choose any particular projects do some experiments and

                  <li>It deals with the transmission and reception of analog signals which are continuous waveforms that vary in amplitude, frequency, and phase over time.</li>
                  <li>Modulation techniques: Modulation is the process of converting the information signal into a form that can be transmitted over a communication channel. Analog communication uses various modulation techniques, such as amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), and phase modulation (PM).

                   <br> Analog modulation circuits: To implement analog modulation techniques, various electronic circuits are used, such as amplitude modulators, frequency modulators, phase modulators, and mixers.
                    
                   <br> Demodulation techniques: Demodulation is the process of extracting the information signal from the modulated carrier signal at the receiver end. Analog communication uses various demodulation techniques, such as envelope detection, synchronous detection, and frequency demodulation.
                    
                   <br> Noise in communication systems: Noise is an unwanted signal that interferes with the transmission and reception of the information signal. In analog communication, various noise sources, such as thermal noise, shot noise, and flicker noise, are discussed.
                    
                   <br> Analog filters: Analog filters are electronic circuits that are used to remove unwanted frequency components from a signal. In analog communication, various types of filters, such as low-pass filters, high-pass filters, band-pass filters, and band-reject filters, are discussed.
                    
                   <br> Transmission lines and waveguides: Transmission lines and waveguides are physical structures that are used to transmit electromagnetic waves over long distances. In analog communication, various types of transmission lines and waveguides, such as coaxial cables, twisted pairs, and optical fibers, are discussed.
                    
                   <br> Antennas: Antennas are devices that are used to transmit and receive electromagnetic waves. In analog communication, various types of antennas, such as dipole antennas, loop antennas, and parabolic antennas, are discussed.
                    
                   <br> Analog communication systems: Analog communication systems are systems that use analog signals for communication. In analog communication, various types of communication systems, such as radio communication systems, television communication systems, and telephone communication systems, are discussed.</li>
